# Pages that are not migrated to jekyll

Can we have redirections for these pages to their new locations?

## Move to Wiki

* [http://www.makehackvoid.com/community/suppliers]()
* Already have been moved, but should add redirections if we can.
  * [http://www.makehackvoid.com/community/network-topology-progress]() 
  * [http://www.makehackvoid.com/community/server-config]()
  * [http://www.makehackvoid.com/community/ltsp-workstations]()

## Move to GitHub

Because this is on it's own url, it could just keep being hosted somewhere

* [http://git.makehackvoid.com/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi]()
* [http://www.makehackvoid.com/community/mhv-git-repository]() - this page should move to wiki if git.makehackvoid.com is going to still need these instructions. If git.makehackvoid.com changes to being an alias for our github account then this page might not be needed

## Archvive

* [http://www.makehackvoid.com/community/how-post-your-project]() This page is fairly specific to drupal. We may need similar instructions for the wiki and for the jekyll pages.
