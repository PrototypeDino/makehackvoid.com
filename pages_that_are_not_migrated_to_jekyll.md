# Pages that are not migrated to jekyll

Can we have redirections for these pages to their new locations?

## Move to Wiki

* [http://www.makehackvoid.com/community/suppliers]()
* Already have been moved, but should add redirections if we can.
  * [http://www.makehackvoid.com/community/network-topology-progress]() 
  * [http://www.makehackvoid.com/community/server-config]()
  * [http://www.makehackvoid.com/community/ltsp-workstations]()
* [http://www.makehackvoid.com/community/forms]()
* [http://www.makehackvoid.com/community/glossary]()
* [http://www.makehackvoid.com/community/ppe]()
* [http://www.makehackvoid.com/community/risk-assessment]()
* [http://www.makehackvoid.com/community/strategic-plan]() Some parts of this might belong on the public website (need updating!)
* **Assets section of website ** Not sure if these just go to static pages on the wiki or if someone wants to setup a database. Out of date. Some items are in the financial reporting spreadsheets on Google docs.
  * [http://www.makehackvoid.com/community/how-donate-or-lend-assets]() The part of this about registing the assets will need to be updated for the wiki (or wherever they end up). Each item on these pages has it's own page. The detailed pages are where the information is about each bit of equipement - we definately want to migrate this for all the tools & 
  * [http://www.makehackvoid.com/assets/books_magazines]()
  * [http://www.makehackvoid.com/assets/computers]()
  * [http://www.makehackvoid.com/assets/consumables]()
  * [http://www.makehackvoid.com/assets/furniture_]()
  * [http://www.makehackvoid.com/assets/all_tools]() I think this includes the next two items
    * [http://www.makehackvoid.com/assets/handheld_tools]() (I think these are probably in the all_tools view?)
    * [http://www.makehackvoid.com/assets/large_tools]() (I think these are probably in the all_tools view?)
  * [http://www.makehackvoid.com/assets/junkpile]()
  * [http://www.makehackvoid.com/community/tool-wishlist]() 

## Move to GitHub

Because this is on it's own url, it could just keep being hosted somewhere

* [http://git.makehackvoid.com/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi]()
* [http://www.makehackvoid.com/community/mhv-git-repository]() - this page should move to wiki if git.makehackvoid.com is going to still need these instructions. If git.makehackvoid.com changes to being an alias for our github account then this page might not be needed

### private github repository
* [http://www.makehackvoid.com/community/tenancy-insurance-documents]()

## Archvive

* [http://www.makehackvoid.com/community/how-post-your-project]() This page is fairly specific to drupal. We may need similar instructions for the wiki and for the jekyll pages.
