We are Make Hack Void, a [Hackerspace\*](#hackerspace) in Canberra, Australia.

[Our space]() [(Map)]() is a community workshop in Downer where members can come to work on their projects, get access to tools and expertise, and meet like-minded people. [Membership]() is $50/year ($30 concession) and there are a range of [access options]().

We hold [Maker Meetups](meetings/) on the 1st, 3rd &amp; 5th Tuesdays of each month where anyone at all can chat, show and tell, get help or advice, and talk about their projects. You don't have to be a member to come to a Meetup.

Our group includes people with extremely diverse interests. Fibreglass moulds to FPGA electronics, Arduinos to DIY pizza ovens. Plus lots more. We're all interested in making things, hacking on projects, and we're not afraid of voiding warranties if we have to.

MakeHackVoid is dedicated to a harassment-free experience for everyone. See our [Code of conduct](code-of-conduct).

If you can't make it to the next meeting then subscribe to the [Makers mailing list](contacts/), follow us on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/makehackvoid), [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=357947732276), or join us in the [IRC channel](contacts/).

### \*About Hackerspaces {#hackerspace}

A hackerspace is a place where people with common interests, usually in science, technology, or digital or electronic art can meet, socialise and collaborate.

When we talk about Hackerspaces and Hacking, we do not mean any kind of unauthorised cracking into third party computer systems, or any other illegal activities. "Real hackers call these people ‘crackers’ and want nothing to do with them."
