# Code of Conduct

MakeHackVoid is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of people at our events or space in any form. People violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the space or the event at the discretion of any MakeHackVoid member.

Our code of conduct can be found here: [MHV Code of Conduct](/community/code-of-conduct).

# Safety
## Common Safety Rules

* Members in the space are encouraged to question safety openly. Any member can veto any other member's activity for stated safety reasons. If this happens it is up to the members present in the space to decide if the concern is valid. If there is any doubt, they can defer the decision to the [committee](/community/committee-contacts).

* If there are any accidents, near misses or injuries and after first aid or 000 calls, fill out an incident form and notify the committee.

* If the emergency services arrive for any reason, notify the committee.

* Avoid working with power tools and especially heavy equipment when alone in the space. Working alone carries serious additional risks if an accident occurs.

* Never use any tool that you don't know how to use safely, or that you do not have appropriate safety equipment for. Ask someone to show you if you are not sure.

* Never work with power tools or heavy equipment while tired or unsure of what you are doing.

## Personal Protective Equipment
* Clothing: Closed footwear only in the workshop. In the machine area loose clothing cannot be worn, and hair must be tied back. Tools that present catch hazards may only be used in the machine area.

* Wear appropriate eye protection when using any tool that may produce swarf (small particles.) Any tool producing significant amounts of swarf can only be used in the machine area.

* Wear ear protection when using any tool that produces high levels of noise. These tools should only be used in the machine area. Notify everyone else in the space before operating a tool that requires ear protection, everyone else in earshot must be protected.

* Wear a dust mask whenever using a tool that produces dust. Dusty work in the machine area only. Anyone nearby needs to wear a mask, and the shopvac must be in use. Roller doors in the other areas should be kept open.

* Activities that require respirators for safe use are not permitted.

* Welding: Wear appropriate eye protection, long sleeves and protective gear (masks, gauntlets) when welding. Weld only in the machine area, and provide advance notice to any others present in the space.

## Operating Hazardous Equipment
* Consider operating tools outdoors whenever possible, to reduce the impact of dust, noise and particles.

* Any hazardous substance must be stored and used as per the MSDS.

* No operating tools, entering the chemical bund or the machine area while under the influence of alcohol or other drugs, including prescription drugs. No intoxicated people ever allowed in the space.

* No operating of lasers or bright light except in a designated area with appropriate signage. No operation of lasers stronger than Class 2 (blink reflex safe) in the space at any time.

## Electrical Safety
* Members working on electrical items must comply with relevant legislation and guidelines at all times.

* A copy of ACTPLA's "Electrical Note 4", summarising electrical licensing in the ACT, is mounted in the space. Members are expected to read and understand it before doing any electrical work.

* Members cannot work on any live mains voltage circuitry in the space, unless they are a licensed electrician. This includes live mains projects, tools, equipment and also fixtures; as well as any part of fixed building and lighting circuits.

* Working on powered ELV (extra-low voltage, less than 50Vrms AC or 120V DC) projects in the space is explicitly permitted, provided these projects are powered from a closed, unmodified, properly connected, insulated (Class 1 or above) power supply that meets relevant standards.

* Working on projects that are intended to be powered by live mains voltage is potentially hazardous. If a member does choose to connect such a project to mains while in the space:

* They must notify all persons present in the space before connecting it to mains.

* They must follow all applicable safety precautions.

* An isolation transformer is provided through which such projects can be initially connected to an isolated circuit (however it is still not permitted to work on the project while it is connected.)

* Members are reminded that even though a project is disconnected from mains electricity, high voltages may still be present (for example, capacitors may need to be discharged.)

* ELV projects are still potentially hazardous. Members are required to exercise appropriate care and precautions, including appropriate fusing and battery care precautions.

## Environmental
* Store heavy objects close to the ground and secure them where possible.

* No food and drink in the chemical bund or machine area.

* Be aware when eating/drinking in the space that there may be pollutants in the air, and take care accordingly. Also remember to wash your hands.

* If other users of the space are generating noise, wear ear protection.


## Tool/Activity Safety Levels
There are four categories of specific tools/activities within the space. Any tool in the space should have a label which indicates which category it belongs to.

1. No specific rules

    Low risk activities, ie using screwdrivers, Stanley knives, and computers.

    It is expected that members know how to use these devices safely. When engaging in these activities you are expected to be safe, follow the common safety rules laid out above, do not abuse tools, and exercise common sense. The rules written above still apply for these items.

2. Rules only

    Low & medium risk (low severity) activities, for example operating a cordless drill.

    A laminated safety rules sheet will be provided and left or put up near the device. This must be read before use, and adhered to.


3. Self-Induction Required

    Medium & some high risk (moderate severity) activities, for example operating an angle grinder.

    A laminated safety rules sheet will be provided and left or put up near the device. Attached to the back is a sheet with a list of inducted signatures. People need to read the sheet and sign their name indicating they understand how to safely use the device, before using it.

4. Full Induction (ie mill)

    High risk activities or activities which require complex knowledge (ie CNC Mill.)

    Members need to be walked through safe use practices on the device in person. A list of approved inductors (people who can do induction) and inductees (people who have been inducted) will be maintained on the web site Asset page for the item. You cannot use this item, or undertake the activity, until you've been inducted.

### Printed Safety Rules

The printed safety rules can be a reformatted/copied relevant section of the user's manual. Manuals should be posted on the web site (on the asset page) where possible.

It is the responsibility of the donor, purchaser, or lender of the tool to provide this relevant safety information when they bring the tool into the space. A printer and laminator will be provided to allow them to do this.

# Access to the Space
* Only members are ever allowed in the space, except for special designated occasions when guests are invited.

* MHV is shared space and every member has an equal right to use the facilities.

* Members should themselves sign in & out in the access book

* 'Space Openers' have keys and alarm codes to access the space. They are asked to open the space whenever they can, and encouraged to post on the mailing list/calendar when they are planing to open the space.

* Members are entitled to be in the space whenever it is open.

* When in the space, all members must keep an eye out for non-members arriving. Ask them to wait until they've been inducted by a member, do not let them use any facilities.

* The member who opened the space is responsible for new members: showing them the rules, giving them a quick induction tour, providing the membership form & collecting their membership fee.

* If the space is to be left unattended, the roller doors should be closed (and locked) & responsibility falls on the 'Space Opener' to secure the space.

* The last 'Space Opener' to leave is responsible for locking all doors, arming all alarms, checking all areas are clean. This is signed off in the access book.

# Cleanliness & Space
* The workbenches, large central table in the general hacking area should be totally clear (except for installed tools) whenever the space is being closed.

* Leave work areas and tools clean and tidy - including as you would like to find it, not as you found it - you are always responsible for leaving it clean.

* There are two 2 "work in progress" lockers, and 2 "work in progress" trolleys for members to keep projects, as well as lockers for members who have them.

* When leaving a "work in progress" you have to label it with your name and the date

* Any larger project can be kept in the space while it's being actively worked on. If the member is not working on it for a month or longer, you need to contact the committee (or the mailing list) and check that it's OK for it to take up space.

# Personal Storage Areas
* Personal storage areas are available to members, but are subject to availability.

* Members are responsible for securing their own personal storage areas (ie buy your own lock.)

* Store your personal property in your personal storage area.

* Don't touch items which are in other people's personal storage areas. Items in common areas are assumed to be shared, unless marked otherwise.

* If a member's membership lapses they are expected to have already cleared their personal storage area. After 14 days items left in the space are forfeit to the association.

# Acceptable Uses of the Space
* The Cisco VoIP Phone is on loan and is for Emergencies and MHV business only. Do not hack the phone!

* MHV is not a house. No one can live there.

* No illegal activities within the space.

* No using computers in the space for copyright infringement, porn, accessing computer systems that you are not authorised to access. We are not a cracking group.

* No devices emitting ionising radiation without prior approval.

* We are not set up for biological hacking, so bring it up with the committee if you want to do it (no guarantee you will be allowed.)

* Damage caused by misuse is responsibility of the user to make good. Fair wear and tear excepted.

* The Committee reserves the right to remove members from the space, or from the association, for breaches of the rules.


# Tools
* Treat all the tools better than you would treat your own.

* Use tools only for their intended purpose, and in accordance with safe operating procedure.

* If a tool has rules about induction (see above), these must be followed before they can be used at all.

* If there any problems with tools, notify the committee as soon as possible (mailing list is good.) Also put a sign or a note on the tool, or put it in the broken tool area.

# Noise 

* Always be considerate and respectful of our neighbours, especially with noise levels at night. 

* To reduce all noise, close the outwards facing roller doors before 10pm.

# Donating or Lending Tools, Consumable & Junk
* Any items brought into or donated to the have to pass all of the safety rules, risk assessment hazards, and be legal and comply with EMF and any other applicable regulations.

* All items donated or lent must be entered on the web site and labelled from the web site. This is responsibility of the donor/lender.

* Items that require safety rules (as above) must have them printed, laminated, and attached near the item before it can be used. This is also the responsibility of the donor/lender.

* The donor/lender vouches for the condition of the item, as per the web site entry.

## Lending Tools & Other Items

* Members (hereafter, lenders) are welcome to lend items to the 
  association on the understanding that they will be made available to 
  members as if they were property of the association.

* In general, the association will prefer to buy their own items 
  whenever practical.

* By default, the association takes no liability for damage or wear and 
  tear of a lent item. It is possible lent items may not be returned in 
  the same condition that they were lent.

* By default, despite not being liable, the association may choose to 
  repair or replace a lent item for the lender. However, this is 
  entirely at the discretion of the association and should not be 
  expected.

* By default, individual members are responsible for 
  consumable costs. However, any consumables that are left with a lent 
  item (and not entered & labelled as consumables) are considered to be 
  offered as donations to the association.

* Either the association or the lender may choose to end the lending 
  period and remove a lent item at any time. If the association chooses 
  this, they must notify the lender and give at least 14 days notice 
  for them to remove the item. If the lender chooses this, they are 
  expected to give notice on the mailing list at some time before the 
  item is actually removed, and also update the web site asset register.

* Removing lent items is always the responsibility of the lender. If an
  item is deemed to be abandoned (after 14 days and no outstanding 
  circumstances), it becomes property of the association.

* In some cases, lenders may want more security over lent items. In 
  these cases, prospective lenders are required to present to the 
  committee:

    * A description of the lent item and its condition.
    * Replacement cost of the lent item, which is proposed as the association's limit of liability.
        (ideally, both these details will be sourced from the web site.)
    * Description, estimated cost & frequency of regular maintenance costs that are to be paid by the association.
    * Description & estimated frequency of regular maintenance tasks that are to be performed by the association, not by the lender.
        
    The association must then decide whether they wish to become
    liable for the item. If the association chooses to take on
    liability then, when the lending period ends, the association
    must choose to provide the lender with any one of the following:

       * The lent item in similar condition to the described condition, 
       (cosmetic wear excepted), with any agreed maintenance 
       completed. This is the preferred option.
                
       * The lent item replaced or repaired to the lender's 
       satisfaction. Not including repairs arising from maintenance
       tasks that the association did not agree to be responsible for.
                
       * The recorded replacement cost, as a payment to the lender. At 
       this point the item (or any remnant of it) becomes property of the association. This is the least preferred option.
        
   If the association chooses to take on liability for the lent
   item, the decision and these details must be noted in the
   Minutes. If they do not choose to take on liability and record
   the decision, it is the lender's decision whether to lend the
   item to the space under the "default" arrangement or remove it.
        
* There is no guarantee of a timeframe on repayment or replacement, the debt may be kept until the association has sufficient funds.

* The association is will regularly review the list of any lent items that they are responsible for

# Consumables
* Some consumables will be bought or provided by the association for free, or donated by members.

* Some consumables (like drill bits) will be bought by the association and provided on a user-pays basis (honour system.)

* Some consumables are BYO by members.

* The first two categories of consumables will be entered on the website.

* Members can request purchases via the committee, voted on at committee meeting on basis of cost vs number of people who can use it

# Junk Pile
* The space has a junk pile. Members can take items from the junk pile to use in their projects.

* If you have something to donate, please do not just dump it in the space. One good approach is to post on the [Makers mailing list](/community/mailing-lists) and ask if it would be useful. Alternatively, bring it along to a maker meetup event and let people check it out in person.

* Any junk left must be useful & unsoiled. No dumping total rubbish. If objects are deemed to have been dumped, the dumper will be notified and expected to remove the item within 14 days.
