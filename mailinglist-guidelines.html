<h2>Mailing List Guidelines</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Be courteous and polite. Acknowledge others&rsquo; thoughts before you make suggestions, and then explain your reasons thoroughly.</li>
    <li>Stay relevant and on-topic during a thread of discussion (start a new thread with a new subject line if changing the topic) - Don&rsquo;t perpetuate long threads unnecessarily. Don&rsquo;t send emails that do not add new information to an existing discussion. - Don&rsquo;t restart an old topic unless you have a progress update on a situation. - If the same point is made twice by the same person, the thread is over.</li>
    <li>Criticism is welcomed, but it must be constructive.</li>
    <li>Address other&rsquo;s arguments and not the individual.</li>
    <li>Don't flame (explanation can be found on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flaming_(Internet)">Wikipedia </a>&nbsp;and the <a href="http://foldoc.org/flame">Online Dictionary of Computing</a>.) This is not a prohibition against expressing your opinion, only about certain methods of expressing it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes a topic will become dangerously close to becoming a heated argument or will be hashed and rehashed so many times that everyone gets sick of the topic. In the name of keeping the peace, the mailing-list administrator reserves the right to declare these topics temporarily off-limits. Right or wrong, you must abide by all the list manager's decisions. The current list managers are the MHV committee.</p>

<h3 id="how_mailing_lists_work">How Mailing Lists Work</h3>
<ul>
    <li>You must be subscribed to the list to post. For those with multiple email addresses, please subscribe each address you wish to post from to the list. You can disable the mail delivery option on your additional accounts to avoid getting multiple copies of the mail</li>
    <li>Please reply in text (not HTML), trimming the email you are responding to to what is relevant. Your responses should be at the bottom of the trimmed mail, or inline if addressing multiple points</li>
    <li>Please do not send attachments to the list. Instead, you may provide the content of the attachment in text format (eg. event details), or post a URL pointing to the attachment.</li>
    <li>If you want to post an image, you can upload an image via <a href="http://imgur.com">imgur.com</a> and then post a URL to the uploaded image.</li>
    <li>Similarly, you can use <a href="http://filepak.com">filepak.com</a> for files.</li>
    <li>If referencing text longer than 10 lines, it is often better to send a link rather than the text.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="netiquette">Netiquette</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Try not to take things personally. Remember you can agree to disagree.</li>
    <li>Not everyone will have the same opinion as you do, but they deserve to be treated as you expect to.</li>
    <li>Avoid angry outbursts. Don&rsquo;t send or reply to email when you are angry. Wait until you have calmed down, then compose the email, or save a draft. As a guide, ask yourself, &lsquo;would I say this to the person&rsquo;s face?&rsquo;</li>
    <li>Email is not the only communication medium we have. If you encounter a contentious subject, consider inviting participants to discuss it in person at the space.</li>
    <li>The Makers list can vary in daily volume. Consider setting up a filter, to direct emails to a separate folder.</li>
    <li>Do not expect any confidentiality. Our mailing lists are available for everyone to read.</li>
    <li>We have members with many different backgrounds. You should explain your reasoning and how you arrived at an idea. Alternatively, ask questions in advance to improve your understanding.</li>
    <li>If you are unfamiliar with &ldquo;netiquette&rdquo;, some good guides are &quot;<a href="http://www.ict.griffith.edu.au/~davidt/email_etiquette.htm">Email Etiquette</a>&quot; and &quot;<a href="http://www.albion.com/netiquette/">The Netiquette Home Page</a>&quot;.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Consequences for breaking the mailing list rules</h2>
<ul>
    <li>If a list administrator sees a member who is breaking mailing list rules, they will email them in private to remind them&nbsp;about the relevant rules. They may choose to formally warn that they have to follow them.</li>
    <li>If the member continues to breach the rules, they may be invited to&nbsp;discuss the issue with another member in the space at a time that is&nbsp;suitable.</li>
    <li>If a warning is given and not heeded then a list administrator may suspend&nbsp;the member's posting privileges for one week. If this occurs, the&nbsp;administrator will email the member and tell them why.</li>
    <li>An appeal on this suspension can be sent to the <a href="http://www.makehackvoid.com/community/committee-contacts">committee</a> via email or&nbsp;raised to committee members in person. The committee members will&nbsp;review the suspension and may lift it early.</li>
    <li>The committee may remove list administrator access if it has had to&nbsp;lift multiple suspensions from a single administrator.</li>
    <li>If the member continues breaking the rule(s) in question after a temporary suspension then the&nbsp;Committee reserves the right to suspend their posting privileges&nbsp;indefinitely, pending any other decision.</li>
    <li>&nbsp;The member can request a review of an indefinite suspension, to take place&nbsp;at any committee meeting.</li>
</ul>
