# Pages that need to be migrated

## News

Lots of small news items, some with images. Would be great if there was a way to use a script to import all of these. ***Need to go in _posts/news/ with filenames based on date - can someone please replace this text with the exact format the file names need to have.***

Need redirections for the individual news items if their urls change.

  * [http://www.makehackvoid.com/category/news?page=1]() through to 
  * [http://www.makehackvoid.com/category/news?page=7]() at the moment
  
## Projects

Lots of these may have links from external sites - important that we set up redirections for them or have them at the same url (which would mean moving them all to the new server.)

Some of these should be migrated, some might be better moved to a project section on the wiki.

Need to go through all of these and decide which to include on jekyll site and which to migrate to wiki.
