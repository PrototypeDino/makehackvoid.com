Our [Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct/) applies to mailing list discussions.

## How Mailing Lists Work
 
 * You must be subscribed to most of our mailing lists to post. The exception to this is the committee mailing list where it is possible to send without being subscribe, but will result in a delay because it has to be manually fowarded by the administrator.
 
 * If you want to use multiple email addresses, please subscribe each address to the list. You can use the mailing list options to disable the mail delivery on the extra email addresses to avoid getting multiple copies of mail from the list.
 
* Please reply in plain text (not HTML), trimming the email you are responding to to what is relevant. Although most email readers now try to hide repeated information, it doesn't always work. So remove anything from the previous post that you are not replying to.

* Please do not send attachments to the list. Instead, you may provide the content in text format (eg. event details), or post a URL pointing to the attachment.

* If you want to post an image, upload it to the web (Lots of options for this including [imgur.com](http://imgur.com), [flickr.com](http://flikr.com), [dropbox.com](http://www.dropbox.com) or [Google+](https://plus.google.com/)) and then post a URL to the uploaded image.

* Discussions are organised into *topic threads* by most email clients based on the email subject line. Make sure you change the subject line if you are changing the topic. 

* Don't flame (explanation can be found on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flaming_(Internet)">Wikipedia </a>&nbsp;and the <a href="http://foldoc.org/flame">Online Dictionary of Computing</a>.) This is not a prohibition against expressing your opinion, only about certain methods of expressing it.

* Do not expect any confidentiality. Our mailing lists are available for everyone to read.

* If you are unfamiliar with *netiquette*, some good guides are [Email Etiquette](http://www.ict.griffith.edu.au/~davidt/email_etiquette.htm) and [The Netiquette Home Page](http://www.albion.com/netiquette/)
